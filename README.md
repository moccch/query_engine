# query_engine
 The unstructured data in this query engine is text data processed by a Name Entity Recognition (NER) ML model. The MVP query engine is designed to support one approximate query, which retrieves an approximate count of name entities in the dataset. The engine is implemented in Python and incorporates SQLite for SQL-like querying.
